# TaxPilot AI

AI-assisted ITR-3 / ITR-4 preparation for **Assessment Year 2026–27**.

TaxPilot AI is an independent tax preparation product. It is **not** affiliated with or endorsed by the Income Tax Department. It does **not** log in to the e-filing portal and never stores portal credentials.

Tax calculations and return preparation are software assistance. Review them before filing.

## What this release does

End-to-end ITR-4 vertical slice:

Signup → dashboard → create return → eligibility (deterministic) → interview → income → deductions → TDS/bank → validation → summary → ITR JSON download.

ITR-3 has data models and screens (P&L / balance sheet tables) but not a complete official mapper.

Document OCR, payments, and live AI providers are **interfaces with development adapters**. They do not fake results.

**Official schema (production authority):** `src/lib/itr-json/schemas/ay2026_27/itr4/schema.json`  
ITR-4_2026_Main_V1.1.json, released 30 Jun 2026, SchemaVer `Ver1.0`, SHA-256 in `metadata.json`.  
Validated with **AJV draft-04**. The old adapter schema is in `.../development/adapter.schema.json` and is **not** used in production.

**ITR-3 is not filing-ready.** JSON download is disabled for ITR-3.

## Run locally

Requires Node 20+. Local development uses PostgreSQL (`docker compose up -d`).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3002

Demo:

- `demo@taxpilot.local` / `password123`
- `admin@taxpilot.local` / `password123`

```bash
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Session JWT |
| `S3_*` | Unused until object storage is wired |
| `AI_PROVIDER` / `OCR_PROVIDER` / `PAYMENT_PROVIDER` | Reserved; current adapters are local/unconfigured |

## Architecture

```
User data → Normalized tax model
  → AY 2026–27 tax engine (normal vs special-rate; 44AD/44ADA; 87A; cess)
  → ITR-4 official mapper
  → AJV validation against official schema
  → Business + tax-calc validation
  → SHA-256 JSON (CURRENT; prior files SUPERSEDED)
```

JSON generation is gated: profile, eligibility, no ERROR issues, official schema pass, bank details, verification. There is no `FILED` status. Maximum: `JSON_GENERATED` / Ready for upload.

Providers (`src/lib/providers`): AI, OCR, storage, payments — swap implementations without touching UI.

## Tests

`npm test` — eligibility, tax engine, deductions, presumptive, official-schema AJV, golden JSON, rounding, authz.

Golden files: `tests/fixtures/itr4/ay2026_27/*.json`

## Production database

Local: SQLite (`DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/dev.db`).  
Production: PostgreSQL. Change `provider` in `prisma/schema.prisma` to `postgresql`, set `DATABASE_URL`, run `docker compose up -d` and `npx prisma migrate deploy`. Models use portable types only.

## Known limitations

- Official CBDT *business* validation rules PDF is referenced, not executed as a rules engine (JSON Schema + our deterministic rules are applied).
- 44AE vehicles UI is partial.
- ITR-3 JSON is disabled.
- Document OCR is unconfigured; extracted values never auto-file.
- No portal filing.

## Next phase

Document extraction (AIS/26AS/Form 16) with human confirmation, then ITR-3 filing-grade mapping.
